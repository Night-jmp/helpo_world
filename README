## About

    As a teaching assistant for Freshman classes, I have found that my students can often struggle with the basics of understanding their build environments and constructing software. As a part of the toorcamp hackathon, I thought that this would be an excellent opportunity to design software that will help my students with difficult issues, while enabling them to learn important skills to apply to their software engineering careers.

## Usage

 Helpo world is super simple to use. Just run the script and answer the prompts to generate your first C program!
